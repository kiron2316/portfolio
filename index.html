    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Kiransinh Parmar, and I am 32 years old. Currently, I am working with Brona as Gig worker. My
        experience includes five years working for a hotel as a housekeeper and four years with a cleaning company. I
        was also a salesperson for 1 year. Whether it is in a hotel or other business area, I am great at cleaning. I am
        a self-motivated person. Cleanliness and neatness are important to me. Throughout my career, I have received
        numerous pieces of feedback from my employers, and most of them have inspired and excited me to do even better.
